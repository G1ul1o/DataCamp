As we say: healthy mind, healthy body. But with the stress of work, the chores and other routines problems, do we have the energy to plan our meals for the week to have a healthy life? Not everyone. But in the age of data and technology we can use it to help us improve our organization. That is what we aim at NutriJourney Company, to help you to be a better version of you.

### How to use it ?
Simplicity is the best !  
You just need to access the website,for that you don't need any account or password, just click on this link <https://project-datacamp.bubbleapps.io/>

After going on the home page you just need to click on the button in the middle of the screen.
