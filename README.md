As we say: healthy mind, healthy body. But with the stress of work, the chores and other routines problems, do we have the energy to plan our meals for the week to have a healthy life? Not everyone. But in the age of data and technology we can use it to help us improve our organization. That is what we aim at NutriJourney Company, to help you to be a better version of you. In this report, you will learn about the final steps of our project: the full implementation of our app, the application logic, snapshots and the CO2 impact of the project.
